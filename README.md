# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Journey

## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Adwaith** (aka `0xW41th`) — a **cybersecurity enthusiast and red team learner** focused on ethical hacking, Linux internals, web exploitation, and Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges.

I’m currently training at **RedTeam Hacker Academy** and actively sharpening my skills through **hands-on labs, CTFs, and real-world attack simulations** on platforms like **TryHackMe** and **PortSwigger**.

This repository serves as a **learning log + knowledge base** documenting what I practice, break, and understand — step by step.
